        <p>The client chose eTouch to architect and build a solution that would alleviate their issues with the third-party application, and at the same time lay a foundation for the application to keep pace with the growth of their infrastructure. With this mandate, the engineering team from eTouch implemented a solution that seamlessly integrated the third-party application with the client's infrastructure and DevOps processes, provided structured data integration pipelines, and added features that enabled forecasting, planning, and analytics. The application was developed in Python on Google AppEngine. The primary drivers for the choice of programming language were:</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li><span class="fa fa-angle-right"></span><span>Reusability of code, since many of the common functions had already been developed within the organization</span></li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-angle-right"></span><span>Better integration with the organization's back-office functions</span></li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-angle-right"></span><span>Availability and scalability characteristics built into the platform</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Over time, the solution evolved to reduce dependencies on the third-party application. Most of its functions were being served over the client's private cloud infrastructure, which in turn helped reduce costs by leveraging the availability and redundancy SLAs of the private cloud.</p>
        <p>eTouch continues to be an essential partner of the client's network teams â€” rolling out new features on a regular basis, and expanding the footprint of the application to other groups in the client's organization.</p>

        <p>eTouch designed and developed the agency's primary public web portal, and integrated the most popular social media and social networking sites into the portal. This involved a cached content delivery network, interventions in operations of two enterprise-scale data centers, implementation of an agency-wide CMS, and full integration of the agency's public content.  eTouch built the platform to meet NASA's SLA requirements like:</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li><span class="fa fa-angle-right"></span><span>Support for 25,000 TPS (Transactions per Second) at the origin servers - The site will utilize a CDN; traffic at the CDN typically is 150,000 TPS for large events. 25,000 TPS flows through to the origin servers</span></li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-angle-right"></span><span>700K+ web content (pages/files in repository)</span></li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-angle-right"></span><span>Varying page sizes - For instance the NASA home page is 250 KB (Text/HTML), post Gzip compression it is ~34 KB, associated content for the NASA home page is an additional 2900 KB</span></li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-angle-right"></span><span>15 Gbps of bandwidth on the CDN end with 3 Gbps flowing to the origin</span></li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-angle-right"></span><span>Availability requirements:
        <ul class="solution">
        <li>99.995% SLA including any planned or unplanned downtime </li>
        <li>100 % SLA during missions which could be a 36 hour timeframe</li>
        </ul>
        </span></li>

        <p>Working with limited metadata, eTouch designed an intranet portal and a single CMS repository for more than three million assets including 500,000 webpages. For the intranet portal, eTouch used open source platforms like Liferay and Alfresco, and commercial products such as Google Search Appliance to improve search relevance. The portal merged more than 10 enterprise applications for content management, forums, knowledge management, and databases. eTouch migrated thousands of resources to the new portal, using an agency-wide taxonomy to classify assets.</p>
        <p>eTouch also created an enterprise-wide community portal, Spacebook, which is based on Liferay portal technology. They migrated all the content of the client's community from their existing intranet portal to Spacebook. For robust and secure access to the agency's applications, eTouch implemented a security platform with centralized authentication, including secure multi-level authentication, for diverse application types.</p>
        <p>They also planned, managed, executed, and monitored infrastructure activities for the Agency Modernization Program. The team delivered value-added, innovative enterprise technology solutions, including hardware, software, shared applications and data, and security, that were integrated into the agency's modernized infrastructure. </p>

The application was developed in Python that afforded better integration with the back-end processes, and also helped leverage some of the common functions that had already been developed. Scalability was an important factor since the application was project to receive millions of page-views per day.</p>
